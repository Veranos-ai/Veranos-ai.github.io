## Sovereign House — Opting out of default biology

**Sovereign House is my personal lab book for becoming a self‑owned human.**

Here I share the things I’m actually running on myself — peptides, protocols, stacks, and the ideas behind them. This is experimental, evolving, and not a polished “wellness brand.”

For now, it’s just my own research, protocols, and notes in public. Over time, it _may_ grow into deeper layers — private vaults, underground discussions, and more structured paths for people who want to push further.
