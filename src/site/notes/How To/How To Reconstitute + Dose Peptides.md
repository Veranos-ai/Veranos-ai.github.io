**Covers all the essentials**
- How to reconstitute (add bac water to the peptide)
- How to measure doses
- Dosage recommendations (consistent with my findings)
- Where to inject

## Supplies
- Typically, **3ml syringes** (you'll probably be doing 1-3ml BAC water max)
- Needle length NOT important - **0.5-1 inch is fine**
- Needle size is LESS important (it's just water) - you can use **25-30g needles**. You can use a bigger 18g, but you risk damaging the vial seal more than you need to.
