**Covers all the essentials**
- How to reconstitute (add bac water to the peptide)
- How to measure doses
- Dosage recommendations (consistent with my findings)
- Where to inject

## Supplies

1. **3ml Syringes** (you'll probably be doing 1-3ml BAC water max)
2. With **0.5-1 inch** length needles
3. With **20-25g diameter** - LESS important (it's just water and not injecting)

- For reconstituting lyophilized peptides with bacteriostatic (BAC) water, a **20–21G needle** is the best practical compromise (easy, fast flow with only modest puncture size). 
- If minimizing stopper damage is your top priority and you don’t mind slower flow, use **23–25G**.
