**Insulin Syringes** with fixed needle (non-removable)- Either 1ml or 0.5ml is fine (100 u or 50 u)

**Easy Touch or BD** - sharpest and smoothest

**Needle Gauge**: The higher number is thinner and will be easier/less painful.
  - Typically, most people use **30g or 31g** ⭐️
  - Up to 32g can work (careful not to bend)
  - Anything 29 and higher will be painless. 29g can work, but don't go lower.

**Needle Length**
- **5/16-Inch (8mm)** - most common.
- Up to 1/2 inch (12.7mm) can be used (just make sure to angle + pinch skin to avoid going too deep (45 deg)
- 4-6mm - works too, usually more for pens
