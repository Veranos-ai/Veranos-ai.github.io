### Initial Goals
- Duration: 8–10 week 
- Weight: 92 kg → 80 kg (75 kg MAX)
- Body fat: 18% → 12%

### Outcome / Success
- End of cut (3 Nov 2025): 78.8 kg — target reached (below 80 kg; no further attempted)
- Estimated body fat: ~12–13% — target reached
- Conclusion: Primary weight and BF goals for the 8–10 week cut were achieved.

### Learnings
- Reta worked very well — even at low doses for me (1–2 mg). Will experiment with higher doses next time (2–4 mg).
- High estrogen issues at 200 mg TRT resolved as body fat decreased. Lower BF correlated with improved management of testosterone and estrogen; able to increase TRT dose without negatives later in the cut.
