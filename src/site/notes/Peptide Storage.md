# (TL;DR) Peptide & BAC Water Guide

## GENERAL STORAGE RULE

**If in doubt → put it in the fridge (2–8°C).**  
This gives the longest lifespan with the least risk.

---

## 1.  LYOPHILIZED PEPTIDES (DRY POWDER)  

**Fridge:** Best.  
    **Lifespan:** 12–24 months (realistic 24–36 months).
**Room temp:**  
    **Lifespan:** 3–6 months (realistic 6–12 months).

**Avoid freezing unless you need 1+ year storage** (thaw cycle risks).

**Most stable:** GLP-1s, CJC/Mod-GRF, HGH  
**Least stable:** MOTS-C + tiny mitochondrial peptides

---

## 2. RECONSTITUTED PEPTIDES (BAC WATER ADDED)

- **Fridge only** → **use within 14–30 days** depending on peptide.
- **Room temp only briefly** when dosing.
- **Never freeze once mixed.**

**Quick guidance by class:**

- **GLP-1s:** 30–45 days (realistic 60)
- **CJC/Mod-GRF:** 14–21 days (realistic 28)
- **HGH:** 14 days (realistic 21–28)
- **Fragile peptides (MOTs-C, GHK-Cu):** 10–14 days (realistic 21)

---

## BAC WATER

**Unopened:**
    - Room temp: **6–12 mo** (realistic 12–18)
    - Fridge: **12–24 mo** (realistic 24–36)
    
**Opened:**
    - Room temp: **30 days**
    - Fridge: **30-60 days**

^ HOWEVER - many people have reported not keeping it in the fridge and using it for MANY months without issues. 

**Do not freeze**
**Assume the manufacture date is within the last 12 months.**

---

## QUICK BEST PRACTICES

- Keep everything in the **fridge**, except while actively dosing.
- Avoid **warming → cooling → warming** cycles.
- Never **shake** peptides (especially HGH + CJC).
- Always use a **fresh sterile needle** when piercing vials.
- Keep vials away from heat, sunlight, and humidity.
- When in doubt about potency → **fridge restores the most margin of safety**.

# (More Detailed) Peptide & BAC Water Guide

## 1️⃣ POWDER (LYOPHILIZED)

### Recommend: Store DRY peptides in a refrigerator (NOT freezer)**

- Long shelf life (1–2 years minimum)
- No degradation concerns
- No “thawing cycle” risk (unlike freezer)
- Safe to remove/restore repeatedly

- Remove briefly only when needed
- Return promptly

**General rules for outside:** keep **cool, dark, dry**, avoid humidity, avoid heat, minimize air exposure.

| Situation                         | Safe or Not? | Explanation                 |
| --------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------- |
| **Fridge → room temp → fridge**   | ✔ Safe       | Not a freeze–thaw cycle     |
| **Freezer → fridge → freezer**    | ❌ Avoid      | Thaw cycle degradation risk |
| **Freezer → room temp → freezer** | ❌ Avoid      | Worst-case scenario         |
|                                   |              |                             |

Only freezer store for max shelf life (1+ years) and be cautious not to refreeze after removal. 

| **Peptide Type**                                                          | **Room Temp** (Best / Realistic) | **Fridge (2–8°C)** (Best / Realistic) | **Freezer (–20°C)**_(Optional)_ |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **GLP-1s** (Retatrutide, Semaglutide, Tirzepatide etc.) — _very stable_   | 1–2 mo / 2–3 mo                  | **12–24 mo / 24–36 mo**               | 2+ yrs / 3–5 yrs                |
| **Fragile Peptides** (MOTs-C, IGF variants, small mitochondrial peptides) | <1 mo / 1–2 mo                   | **6–12 mo / 18–24 mo**                | 12–24 mo / 24–30 mo             |
| **Mod-GRF (1–29), CJC-1295, Ipamorelin, GHRP family**                     | 1–2 mo / 2–3 mo                  | **12–24 mo / 24–36 mo**               | 2+ yrs / 3–5 yrs                |
| **HGH (Somatropin)** — _freeze-dried very stable_                         | 1–2 mo / 2–3 mo                  | **12–24 mo / 24–36 mo**               | 2–3 yrs / 4–5 yrs               |
### **Room Temp**

- Works fine for short-term storage **if kept cool and dry**
- Heat + humidity (e.g., Thailand) reduces safe time by **~50%**
    

### **Fridge (2–8°C)**

- **Best all-purpose storage** for resale or long-term personal stock
- No issues with removing/replacing vials (not a thaw cycle)
    

### **Freezer (–20°C)**

- Optional
- Only ideal if **you** store long-term for personal use
- **BE CAREFUL** → thaw cycles degrade peptides

## 2️⃣ RECONSTITUTED (WITH BAC WATER)

**Rules:** Fridge only (2–8°C). Do not freeze. No shaking — gentle swirl only.

# **NOTES & RULES OF THUMB**

### **1. Temperature cycling hurts stability**

- Keep in fridge between uses
- Only take out long enough to draw dosage
- Avoid repeated warm–cold–warm cycles
    

---

### **2. Cloudiness after refrigeration**

Common for: **GLP-1s, Mod-GRF/CJC**

- Let vial sit **5–10 min** at room temp
- Do **not** shake — gentle swirl only

---

### **3. BAC water helps but doesn’t fully protect**

It slows bacterial growth, **not** degradation.  
Fragile peptides still degrade quickly.

---

### **4. If manufacturer date is unknown**

Assume it was produced recently (1–3 months).  
This is normal for nearly all peptide suppliers.

---

### **5. Never freeze reconstituted peptides**

Freezing damages peptide structure post-mixing.  
(Also avoids user error with thaw cycles.)

## 3️⃣ BACTERIOSTATIC WATER


BAC WATER — EFFECTIVE USE TIME TABLE**

| **Status**             | **Room Temp (20–25°C)** — Best Practice | **Room Temp — Realistic** | **Fridge (2–8°C)** — Best Practice | **Fridge — Realistic** | **Notes**                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unopened BAC Water** | 6–12 months                             | 12–18 months              | 12–24 months                       | 24–36 months           | Sterile until opened. Stable when stored cool and dry. Keep out of sunlight.                                                        |
| **Opened BAC Water**   | 10–14 days                              | Up to 30 days             | 30 days                            | 60 days                | Best practice = fridge after first use. Benzyl alcohol slows bacteria but does not eliminate contamination risk. Do **not** freeze. |

# **NOTES & RULES OF THUMB**

### **1. Once opened, refrigeration is strongly recommended**

You _can_ leave opened BAC water at room temp, but:

- It shortens safe-use time
- Increased contamination risk
- Warm/humid climates reduce lifespan by ~50%

**Best practice:** Keep in fridge immediately after first pierce.

---

### **2. Do NOT freeze BAC water**

Freezing can create sterility issues due to microfractures in the container and temperature-related instability.

---

### **3. “Manufacture date unknown” guideline**

If there is no expiry printed:

**Assume the manufacture date is within the last 12 months**  
(This is industry standard for nearly all BAC water suppliers.)

So:

- **Unopened, room temp:** safe 6–12 months from _now_
- **Unopened, fridge:** safe 12–24 months from _now_

---

### **4. Avoid repeated needle entries**

Even with benzyl alcohol:

- Use a clean sterile needle each time
- Wipe the septum with alcohol before piercing
    

This extends real-world safety toward the “realistic” timelines.

---

### **5. Keep out of light and heat**

Both degrade benzyl alcohol faster and reduce sterility time.
