This is the plan I used very successfully for around 6 months.

Specifically, I found it good for:
- **Cutting/dieting** while maintaining strength + muscle
- **Rebuilding/regaining** strength quickly - after a diet phase or time off

It's only **3 times per week** so it's pretty easy to keep it up, works for Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

 " / " Gives an alternative exercise I also liked.
 - The Full Body is worked every workout
 - There is **1 exercise per muscle group**, with **2 sets only** - every workout

#### Modifications
I suggest swapping for your **personal preferred exercises** over time. These exercises worked well for me for activation and low injury strain. Feel free to try them. 

I recommend sticking with the **established muscle groups + sets** for each.
- Want more chest bias over shoulders? Swap Chest / Shoulders to Chest only. i.e Workout B change to a chest exercise

#### Quick overview

- **Frequency**: HIGH - Every body part 3× per week (train Mon / Wed / Fri).
- **Volume**: LOW — only 2 HARD working sets per exercise.
- **Intensity**: HIGH — push to ~1 rep shy of failure on those 2 work sets (RPE ~8–9).
- **Structure**: Alternate Workout A / B (Mon A, Wed B, Fri A — then next week start with B).
- **Recovery-friendly**: Lots of rest between sessions
- Cardio may be added if you want, but its not needed. Aim for daily steps for general health  (5,000–10,000).

#### Warm‑up and set structure

- **Warm up**: 2 light WARM UP sets BEFORE your 2 hard work sets (use progressively heavier, low‑fatigue sets for blood flow and activation).
- **Work sets**: 2 WORK sets only. Aim to be 1 rep shy of technical failure.
- **REST** between WORK sets: these are high intensity sets, so longer rest times are needed. 
  **3 minutes** worked well for me. I wouldn't do less than 2 minutes 

#### Rep ranges & how to use them

Overall preferred OVERALL ranges are between 6–15 reps.

E.g
- Heavy (strength focus): 6–8 or 6–10.
- Medium: 8–12 or 8–10.
- Light / isolation: 10–15 

Key point: **Rep range is less important than intensity** — keep the final reps hard (1–2 reps from failure). 
- Choose rep range per exercise to **maximize activation and manage fatigue**. (e.g., lateral raises often feel better 10–15 vs 6-8).

Progression rule (keep it simple): once you can complete the top of the rep range on both work sets with good form, increase weight by the smallest available step (or add 1–2 reps next session).

#### Why this approach works for me

- **High frequency** gives repeated practice and frequent stimulus for each muscle while keeping weekly volume low.
- **Low total volume + high intensity** allowed quicker recovery and made it sustainable 3×/week.
- Worked well for **maintaining strength on a cut** and for **regaining strength after time off.**
- May continue to work long term, but if you push for frequent PRs or find recovery worsening (or progress stalling), consider then moving to a 4‑day split later. (I'm doing this)

#### Practical tips & personalization

- **Swap exercises if an exercise doesn't feel right** for your joints or activation. These are what worked for me — try them and change if needed.
- **For shoulder vs chest prioritization**: swap the shoulder press for another chest movement on workouts where you want extra chest emphasis.
- **Track sets, reps, and RPE**. If recovery or performance drops, reduce load, add a deload week, or switch to a 4‑day split.
- If you want more volume later, add a light back‑off set (only if recovery allows), or add a 4th training day — otherwise keep it minimal.

#### Recovery & conditioning

- Keep non‑training activity moderate: 5–10k steps/day recommended for general health. No extra cardio required — don’t add long, intense cardio on lifting days if your goal is strength/muscle and recovery.
