Note: I've not run this personally yet. But here are my findings so far a protocol I'm going to try.

## General Guidance

→ Typical dose: 5–15 mg per week, split into 2–3 injections
→ Injection frequency: 2–3x weekly (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
→ Cycle length: 2–4 weeks on, followed by 2–4 weeks off
→ Injection method: Subcutaneous (abdomen, thigh, or flank area)
Beginners often start with 5 mg/week and titrate up based on response and tolerance.

## My First Experiment Run

### Testing
I'm going to try this first (2-3 weeks):
**2.5 mg MWF** → 3 injections/week → **7.5 mg/wk**

### Ramping
Potentially increase this later:
**5 mg MWF** → 3 injections/week → **15 mg/wk**
(if well tolerated and supply/budget allows)


Note: You could also run these EOD (Every Other Day) injections if preferred - weekly dose will be slightly higher too.
