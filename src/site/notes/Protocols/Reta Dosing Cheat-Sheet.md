## The Protocol 

- Start LOW.
- Watch how your body responds.
- Only increase if you NEED to.

The biggest mistake is thinking higher doses = faster results.  
Retatrutide works best when you’re patient, structured, and consistent.

### 1: Choose Once Weekly vs Split Dosing

One weekly shot vs. splitting = similar results
BUT… doses **over 2mg** in one go often cause nausea

Splitting the dose helps avoid these side effects

**Example:**
- SPLIT into 2: Mon / Thu (my preferred)
OR
- SPLIT into 3: Mon / Wed / Fri

If you prefer simplicity, **one shot per week is fine.** 
Some users report a stronger appetite suppression with less shots (bigger doses)

### 2: Minimum Effective Starting Dose

Start at the Minimum effective dose FIRST.
➡️ **1mg per week** - Good place to start. 

Don’t change anything else.
- Not your diet.
- Not your training.
- Not your cardio.

Notice how your body behaves and reacts.
At **1mg**, you won’t drop a ton of fat in 7 days.

What you SHOULD notice is:
✔️ Appetite changes
✔️ Craving control
✔️ Energy shifts

If after 1-2 weeks **1mg** feels GOOD, and seems to work you have two choices:

→ Milk it for as long as possible. Potentially a couple more weeks.
OR
→ move straight to **2mg** (if you're tolerating it well)

This is where most people start to see:
✔️ Fat loss kick in
✔️ Cravings suppressed
✔️ More energy day to day

Then, if you’re progressing at **2mg** → STAY THERE as long as you can
**2–3mg** per week = Sweet spot for many

### 3: Increasing Your Dose

Only consider increasing your dose
- If fat loss slows…
- If appetite creeps back in…
- If cravings spike again…

And you're not encountering significant side effects)

Then, and ONLY then, move up:
➡️ to 3mg
➡️ to 4mg
➡️ to 5mg

➡️ Sometimes 6mg

BUT..
More does NOT equal better.
If you’re progressing well at 2–3mg → stay there.

**Don't jump faster than 1mg at a time**; give **at least 1 week** to access the new dose
### 4: Typical Effective Ranges

- Cutting → **2–4mg** (sometimes 6–8mg max)
- Bulking → **1–2mg** (never needed more) - more is going to risk reducing your appetite too much


### Summary
- **One weekly shot and split dosing give similar results** — but single doses >2 mg often cause nausea, so split if needed (e.g., Mon/Thu or Mon/Wed/Fri).
- **Start at the minimum effective dose**: **1 mg/week**. Don’t change diet, training, or cardio while assessing. Expect appetite/craving and energy changes first, not big fat loss in 7 days.
- If 1 mg is well tolerated, either continue or increase to **2 mg**. Most people hit the “sweet spot” at **2–3 mg/week** (fat loss, appetite suppression, more energy).
- **Only increase further if progress stalls or cravings return** — moves to **4 mg** (sometimes up to 6 mg) may be used, but more isn’t always better.
Typical ranges: 
- Cutting = **2–4 mg** (occasionally 6–8 mg max); 
- Bulking = **1–2 mg** (avoid higher or you’ll lose appetite).

| Single shot vs split dosing       | Single ≤2 mg OK; >2 mg often causes nausea                           | Split if >2 mg — examples: Mon/Thu (2x) or Mon/Wed/Fri (3x)                   | Splitting reduces nausea and other side effects                           |

| Cutting (typical)                 | 2–4 mg (sometimes up to 6–8 mg max)                                  | Adjust based on progress & side effects                                       | Higher ranges used short-term; watch for excessive appetite loss          |
| Bulking (typical)                 | 1–2 mg                                                               | Keep low to avoid reducing appetite too much                                  | Rarely need more than 2 mg; higher doses counterproductive                |

## Monitoring / Side Effects

During my experiments with the lowest effective doses up to 2mg/week so far, it did not notice any side effects other than slight Nausea while getting used to doses changes. 

If you experience the common side effects, it's likely to improve as you get used to it. Either stick with the dose and see if it improves, decrease it or split the weekly dosage (if you're not already).
## Practical tips

- Start at low dose and titrate slowly to reduce GI side effects
- Stay hydrated; treat nausea early (antiemetic as advised by clinician)
- Monitor blood glucose if diabetic or on glucose-lowering drugs
- Report persistent or severe GI symptoms, jaundice, severe abdominal pain, or signs of allergic reaction immediately

## Common / expected (usually early, often improves over weeks)

- Nausea (most common)
- Vomiting
- Diarrhea or constipation
- Abdominal pain or bloating
- Reduced appetite / early satiety
- Headache, fatigue, dizziness
- Injection‑site reactions (redness, itching)
## Less common but important

- Heart rate increase / palpitations
- Dehydration (from prolonged vomiting/diarrhea)
- Changes in taste or belching
