Goals:
1. **Cut fat as fast as possible** to get to your goal body fat % with **minimal muscle loss**.
2. Rapid results in **8–10 weeks**, then immediately return to maintenance and rebuild any lost strength in **2–4 weeks**. 
3. **Aim ~1–2 kg weight loss per week on average**.

### Quick Overview

Prep 2–4 weeks → Cut 8–10 weeks → Transition 2–4 weeks 

#### 1. Prep — 2–4 weeks (required)
- Be at maintenance calories for 2–4 weeks before starting
- Be on TRT for at least 2–4 weeks before starting (ideally longer)
- Run FBW x3 week for 2–4 weeks so you are at usual strength level.

- Spend 1 week at **maintenance kcal with Reta at 1 mg/week**.
- Start the cut only after all items above are complete.

#### 2. Cut — 8–10 weeks
- Calories: fix at 1,000–1,200 kcal/day (do NOT go below 1,000).
- Training: FBW x3 week — maintain strength (do not chase strength gains).
- TRT: 120–200 mg/week (split 3× or ≥2×/wk).
- Reta: start 1 mg/week (split 500 mcg Mon/Tue); adjust per the Reta Cheatsheet as needed.
- Other: berberine 500 mg with first & last big meals, creatine 5–10 g/day, hydration (~4 L/day), ~8 h sleep, ≥5k steps/day.

- **Aim: ~1–2 kg/week average weight loss**. Track daily/weekly and adjust Reta or steps only if adherence is solid and you stall.

#### 3. Transition / Rebuild — 2–4 weeks
- Immediately return to maintenance calories.
- Continue FBW and focus on rebuilding strength.
- Continue TRT and follow Reta Cheatsheet for dosing guidance.
- **Expect ~1–2 kg rebound (water + glycogen)** — not fat. Continue tracking.

Notes: The diet (1000–1200 kcal) is the primary driver of weight loss; Reta supports energy, appetite suppression and fat burning.

### Fixed rules (do not change during 8–10 weeks)

| Rule                        | Details                                                             | Exception / What to do                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| TRT                         | Keep the same dose (120–200 mg/wk)                                  | Decrease only if you experience high estrogenic (E) side effects.                                                        |
| FBW program                 | Stick with [[Protocols/FBW 3x Low Vol Workout Plan\|FBW 3x Low Vol Workout Plan]]                          | Do not switch program. If energy drops mid-session, reduce volume (e.g., cut 2 sets → 1) rather than increase intensity. |
| Diet kcal                   | Fix total daily kcal at 1,000–1,200                                 | If started at 1,200 and stalling, drop to 1,000. Never go below 1,000.                                                   |
| Water / Sleep / Supplements | Keep consistent (4 L water, ~8 h sleep, maintain vitamins/minerals) | No routine changes — essential to prevent deficiencies and aid recovery.                                                 |
| Cardio / Steps              | Keep low and consistent; aim for normal walking (≥5,000 steps/day)  | Only increase as last-resort to break a stall (up to 10–15k). Avoid adding mandatory extra cardio.                       |


---

### Variables (what you may adjust)

- Reta dose per [[Protocols/Reta Dosing Cheat-Sheet\|Reta Dosing Cheat-Sheet]] is the **primary adjustable variable** during the cut. Everything else stays stable.

Stall protocol (if weekly loss stops or slows below goal):

1. First, confirm tracking data (kcal adherence, training, sleep, steps, dosages).
2. If adherence good, consider increasing Reta per [[Protocols/Reta Dosing Cheat-Sheet\|Reta Dosing Cheat-Sheet]] (typically +0.5–1.0 mg/week).
3. If energy allows, add light cardio or increase daily steps (as last resort).
4. If started at 1,200 kcal, you may drop to 1,000 kcal. Do not go below 1,000.

---

### Constructing the diet (PSMF-style guidance)

Targets to lock when constructing your own daily menu:
- Total kcal: 1,000–1,200 (fix it and repeat the same meals)
- Protein: ≥120 g/day (aim to meet or exceed this)
- Fat: ~15–20% of total kcal (keep fat minimal)
- Carbs: remainder (mostly from fruit; typically ~200–500 kcal)

Food composition: mostly protein with minimal carbs/fats. Prefer home-cooked or precooked meals to control kcal. 

Occasional meals out may reach 1,500–1,800 kcal — limit these to 1–2/week max.

Core food options:
- Chicken + eggs OR beef (5–10% fat) — these meet protein + small fat needs.
- Low-kcal filling veg (green beans, carrots, tomatoes, herbs).
- Minimal sauces (avoid sugar-containing sauces).
- Fruit for minimal carbs/sweet tooth (oranges, papaya, kiwis)

Example baseline daily (boring but effective):

| Meal / Item                          | Serving                                                           | kcal  | Protein (g) | Fat (g) | Carbs (g) |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----------- | ------- | --------- |
| Meal 1 — Chicken + egg + veg         | 200 g cooked chicken breast + 1 large egg + 100 g veg             | 420   | 68          | 12      | 5         |
| Meal 2 — Chicken + egg + veg         | 200 g cooked chicken breast + 1 large egg + 100 g veg             | 420   | 68          | 12      | 5         |
| Pre-bed snack — fruit + Greek yogurt | 150 g mixed fruit + 100–150 g low-fat Greek yogurt                | 270   | 12          | 3       | 28        |
| Veg / seasoning                      | herbs, tomatoes, green beans (low kcal) **Don't need to measure** | -     | -           | -       | -         |
| Daily total (example)                |                                                                   | 1,110 | 148         | 27      | 38        |

Construct one sustainable meal set using these principles, calculate kcal/macros once, and repeat.

Notes for building the menu:
- Swap chicken+eggs for beef (5–10% fat) if preferred — adjust portion to keep fat ≤20% kcal.
- Use low-calorie veg to add volume (green beans, carrots, tomatoes, herbs).
- Avoid sugary sauces; prefer simple seasonings.
- Calculate the kcal/macros once for your chosen foods and then repeat the same daily set for consistency.

### Daily & weekly tracking (MANDATORY)

Daily:
- Calories / adherence
- Reta dose, TRT dose, other meds/supps
- Workout performed (yes/no) and general energy/feelings
- Sleep hours, steps

Per workout (each session):
- Sets, reps, weights — track to monitor strength preservation

Weekly:
- Body weight and weekly trend (expect ~1–2 kg/week)
- Review all logs to decide adjustments (Reta, steps, kcal if started at 1,200 and stalling)


### Weekly tracking — example table

|Week (start)|Avg body weight (kg)|Weekly change (kg)|Avg daily kcal|Avg protein (g/day)|Avg sleep (hrs)|Avg steps/day|Workouts completed (of 3)|Strength trend (↑ / = / ↓)|Reta dose change this week|Actions / Notes|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|2025-11-17|87.0 → 86.2|-0.8|1,100|138|7.6|6,500|3/3|= (maintained)|None|

---

### End-of-cut: immediate transition (2–4 weeks)

1. After 8–10 weeks is complete, immediately return calories to maintenance (**calculate your new maintenance based on current body weight**).
2. Expect ~1–2 kg rebound (water + glycogen) — not fat. Continue tracking

3. Continue FBW 3x week and priority = rebuild any lost strength over 2–4 weeks.
4. Keep TRT during this period. Consider coming off after 2-3 months if you wish.
5. Reta you can either continue - or decrease to a maintenance dose - or come off completely (be aware your hunger will slowly return to baseline)

6. Monitor strength via tracked sets/reps/weights and adjust volume/intensity upward as energy & recovery allow.
