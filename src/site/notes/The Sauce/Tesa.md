**What is Tesamorelin?**
Tesamorelin is a synthetic growth hormone–releasing hormone (GHRH) analog that stimulates the pituitary gland to release growth hormone (GH), increasing insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels. 

It’s FDA-approved for treating HIV-associated lipodystrophy, but it’s also used in wellness and aesthetic medicine to reduce abdominal fat, improve metabolism, and support muscle preservation.

**What are the benefits of tesamorelin?

Tesamorelin helps reduce visceral fat, improve body composition, and support a healthier metabolism. By stimulating the natural release of growth hormone, it promotes fat breakdown, muscle preservation, and better energy balance. Many users also notice improved sleep, recovery, and cognitive clarity after consistent use.

Supports a leaner, more defined physique by targeting stubborn abdominal fat while maintaining muscle mass. It may also enhance energy levels, workout recovery, libido, and sleep quality — benefits often linked to higher natural growth hormone activity.

Recommended Dosages
The standard tesamorelin dosage is 2 mg injected subcutaneously once daily

**How long until Tesamorelin kicks in?**  

Most people begin noticing changes within four to six weeks of consistent daily use, though significant fat reduction and body composition improvements may take three to six months. Results depend on lifestyle, diet, and adherence to the prescribed dosage.

Although some individuals may notice subtle changes sooner. The effects depend on your individual response, dosage, and lifestyle.

Timeline for tesamorelin effects

- **1–2 weeks:** You may begin to notice slight reductions in visceral fat.
- **4–8 weeks:** Reductions in abdominal fat may become more significant, along with potential improvements in lipid profiles and muscle mass.
- **8–12 weeks:** The more noticeable benefits of treatment, including enhanced body composition and better cognitive function, typically become evident.
- **3–6 months:** Most patients will achieve significant reductions in visceral fat and body composition changes within this period.
- **Beyond 6 months:** Clinical trials for HIV-associated lipodystrophy have shown that continued treatment for up to 52 weeks sustained the reduction in visceral fat.

Key Benefits
- Reducing abdominal or visceral fat  
- Preserving lean muscle mass  
- Enhancing recovery and metabolism  

2 mg daily dose typically remains standard
